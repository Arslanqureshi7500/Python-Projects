1. Perform EDA on the Dataset Which should include

    a. Visualization and explore the data using seaborn

          i. Add your findings about the data under each graph in the code                

              notebook

    b. Identify the data patterns if exist for single/multiple variables

          i. Write your findings under the plots or code that identify the pattern

     c. Clean the dataset, remove the missing values

          i. Explain your approach in the Collab notebook text cell

     d. Select the target variable and clearly mention the reason for selecting 

          it.

     e. Transform the Dataset

            i. Transform the whole dataset (Features , Target Variable)

      f. Split the Dataset into train and test set



2. Use the Scikit Learn Library to fit the Regression Models

     a. Use the different regression models

          i. Linear regression

          ii. Decision tree Regressor

          iii. Random forest Regressor

          iv. Gradient boosting Regressor

     b. You have to report the MSE result with the following combinations

          i. Without feature scaling

          ii. With only feature scaling (without target variable)

          iii. With feature and target variable scaling

     c. Display the ranking of different models according to their MSE value
